# AvalonDock

AvalonDock is a WPF Document and Tool Window layout container that is used to arrange documents
and tool windows in similar ways than many well known IDEs, such as, Eclipse, Visual Studio,
PhotoShop and so forth. Here are some CodeProject articles:

My IDE called [Edi](https://dirkster99.github.io/Edi/) is powered by this project.

This project contains **additional bug fixes and a feature added** fork from:
https://github.com/xceedsoftware/wpftoolkit

Be sure to checkout the [Wiki for more details](https://github.com/Dirkster99/AvalonDock/wiki). The repository also contains a Log4Net branch for debugging interactive issues with a close enough branch. There are also Log4Net demo executables in the 3.4.01 (or later) realease for additional debugging fun.

# Feature Added - Dark and Light VS 2013 Theme
